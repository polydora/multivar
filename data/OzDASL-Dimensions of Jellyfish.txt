    Description

Dimensions in millimetres are given of two samples of jellyfish from
Hawkesbury River in New South Wales, Australia. One of the samples came
from Dangar Island and the other from Salamander Bay. The first column
contains a "D" if the measurement came from Dangar Island and a "S" if
it came from Salamander Bay. The dimensions measured were length and
width. What can one learn from graphing the two principal components?
Try graphing principal components of the logarithms of the measurements.
Can the dimensions determine the location?
